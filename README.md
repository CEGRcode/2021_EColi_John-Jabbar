## Abstract
When performed at single bp resolution, the genome-wide location, occupancy level, and structural organization of DNA binding proteins provides mechanistic
insights into genome regulation. Here we use ChIP-exo to provide the first high resolution view of the epigenomic organization of the E. coli transcription
machinery and nucleoid structural proteins when cells are growing exponentially and upon rapid reprogramming (acute heat shock). We suggest that indirect
readout of DNA shape at the flanks of cognate motifs provide major contributions to site specificity at promoter positions -35/-24 and -10/-12. We examined
the site specificity of three sigma factors (RpoD/sigma70, RpoH/sigma32, and RpoN/sigma54), RNA polymerase (RNAP or RpoA, B, C) and two nucleoid proteins 
(Fis and IHF). Our results confirm and refine reports that RpoD binds most annotated promoters, whereas RpoH and RpoN bind a much smaller subset, each through
their cognate motifs. However, only upon heat shock does RpoH becomes active for RNAP recruitment. In contrast, upon heat shock RpoD remains active at its
cognate promoters (including at heat shock genes), whereas RpoN remains inactive at its cognate promoters. RpoN binds ~1,000 non-annotated RpoN motifs, which
may reflect a large number of condition-specific transcription units. Occupancy patterns of sigma factors and RNAP suggest a common promoter recruitment
mechanism that differs from the long-standing views that sigma and RNAP are co-recruited as a complex, and also simultaneously dissociate from promoters. Our
findings suggest that sigma factors are recruited and/or maintained at most promoters via an RNAP-independent mechanism. When RNAP arrives, it dwells for a 
relatively short time before clearing the promoter, leaving sigma behind. Taken together these findings add new dimensions to how sigma factors achieve 
promoter specificity through DNA sequence and shape and redefine mechanistic steps in regulated promoter assembly in E. coli.
