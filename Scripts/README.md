Combining Chexmix+Genetrack_top500.R
R script to combine ChExMix and Genetracks peaks to a single file. Script removes duplicate peaks calls, sorts the remaining peaks by occupancy, and then outputs this data. Additionally, the top 500 peaks by occupancy are output as a separate file to be used for for MEME motif discovery.

correlation_coeff_v2.py
Calculates the correlation coefficient between datasets and generates the corresponding heatmaps.

genetrack.py
Genetrack peak-caller script used for genetrack peak calls

sum_Row_CDT.pl
Calculates the sum of the individual peaks across a given matrix. Used to create the composite plots shown in the paper.
